  Coding-Challenge

  For this coding challenge you will build a webpage based off of a mockup image.
  Follow the steps below to complete the challenge.

  1. Fork this repo, to create a new repository of your own, to share with your completed work.

  2. You should have an **index.html** file, along with **assets, css, js,** and **mockup** folders.

  3. Check the **mockup** folder for the two responsive sizes you'll be creating.

  4. Palette colors will be provided in the HTML file.

  5. Our project uses the **"Roboto"** and **"Roboto Condensed"** font face weights 100 and 700. _Use whatever method you want to access the font._

  6. Have the main content centered and a max width of 563px in mobile view and 960px in desktop.

  7. Use font-awesome where required.

  8. On each orange button of the cards, a user can click on the button and toggle between the text in the mockup and "Hide [Giving Plan/Charity]" with the icon switched to the eye-slash icon.

  9. Once you are finished please open a pull request to the main repo so that we can go over your work!

  **_Bonus Points_** 

  1. When a user clicks on the orange button to show/hide content, switch the card content to show dummy data with a card header and card body. (Feel free to style this the best way you see fit with the theme.)

  We encourage the use of Vanilla JavaScript but feel free to use any package/tools you wish but be ready to discuss why you used them and where you used it. (Because we can learn from you, too)

  A copy of these instructions can be found in the **index.html** file, as well.

  If you have ANY trouble, feel free to open an issue in the main repo and we will be happy to assist.
