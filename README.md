# Coding-Challenge

For this coding challenge you will build a webpage based off of a mockup image.
Follow the steps below to complete the challenge.

1. Fork this repo, to create a new repository of your own, to share with your completed work.

2. You should have an **index.html** file, along with **assets, css, js,** and **mockup** folders.

3. Check the **mockup** folder for the two reponsive sizes you'll be creating.

4. Palette colors will be provided in the HTML file.

5. If you can, set this project up to use SASS that compiles down to CSS.

6. Our project uses the **"Roboto Condensed"** font face weights 100 and 700. _Use whatever method you want to access the font._

7. Have the main content centered and a max width of 563px in mobile view and 960px in desktop.

8. Use font-awesome where required.

9. On each orange button of the cards, use JS so that the user can click on the button and toggle between the text in the mockup and "Hide [Giving Plan/Charity]" with the icon switched to the eye-slash icon. 

**_Bonus Points_** if you can set this project up to use SASS and have it compile down to CSS.

Feel free to use any packages you prefer but be ready to discuss the tools you used and where you used it. (Because we can learn from you, too)
A copy of these instructions can be found in the **index.html** file, as well.

If you have ANY trouble, feel free to open an issue and we will be happy to assist.
